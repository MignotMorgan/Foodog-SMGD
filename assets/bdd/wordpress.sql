We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible.

It worked, and we’ve been scared to give our dogs human food ever since. While the kibble guys were right in that you don’t want to train your dog to beg at the table or feed those garlic potatoes you just fried up, most people are starting to understand that a fresh food diet is a much healthier option for dogs. What some pet owners may not know is that even feeding the right table scraps can also be healthful and beneficial.\r\n<h4><b>How</b><b> do I know what “real” foods I can feed my dog?</b></h4>\r\nAvoid anything fried or cooked with additives and stick with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/">whole, fresh foods</a> like meat, vegetables, and fruit. These are best in their natural states or lightly cooked, and are not only safe for your dogs, but also beneficial for their health. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/">Fresh food is also easier for your pup to digest</a> than processed dog food and can lead to better breath, a shinier coat, and a trimmer waistline. How many brown balls of kibble can promise that?\r\n\r\nRemember, a few pieces of fresh turkey or broccoli in your dog’s bowl can be an amazing snack, but doesn’t count as a regular, balanced meal. If you want to experience the benefits of switching your dog over to an all-fresh diet, make sure you’re feeding<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/"> nutritionally balanced recipes</a> that have been formulated by a veterinary nutritionist.\r\n<h4><b>Any specific table scraps I should avoid?</b></h4>\r\nWhile certain table foods are safe to share with your dog, you should keep the pizza and French Fries for your own cheat days. Everyone knows about chocolate, but here’s a quick recap of the table scraps that still deserve their bad rep.\r\n\r\n– Fried foods or dishes with added salt and spices\r\n\r\n– Most Americans cook with copious amounts of butter and oil, making many holiday dishes a potential nutritional land mine for dogs (and humans)\r\n\r\n– Garlic and onion (they contain <i>allium</i>, which can damage your dog’s red blood cells and even cause them to burst)\r\n\r\n– Grapes and raisins (the exact toxin in this fruit family hasn’t been pinpointed, but grapes are high on the No Fly List for your dog’s bowl)\r\n\r\n– Packaged foods (artificial sweeteners like <em>x</em><em>ylitol</em> can sneak into packaged desserts, candies, and condiments and are some of the most dangerous ingredients for dogs)\r\n\r\n– Peaches and avocados (peach pits are poisonous, to say nothing of their danger as a choking hazard, while avocados contain a toxin called <i>persin</i>)\r\n\r\n– Tomato plants (a ripe tomato is fine, but a green tomato or any part of the plant itself can be toxic)\r\n\r\n– Cooked bones (chicken bones, we’re looking at you)\r\n\r\n– Raw potatoes (cooked is safe, but skip the buttery mashed variety)\r\n\r\nWhile your pup would no doubt love a plate of macaroni and cheese this holiday, rich foods can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even pancreatitis if consumed in high quantities. The good news is that your dog will be just as happy enjoying a plate of steamed Brussels sprouts dressed in Turkey broth.

What some pet owners may not know is that even feeding the right table scraps can also be healthful and beneficial.\r\n<h4><b>How</b><b> do I know what “real” foods I can feed my dog?</b></h4>\r\nAvoid anything fried or cooked with additives and stick with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/">whole, fresh foods</a> like meat, vegetables, and fruit. These are best in their natural states or lightly cooked, and are not only safe for your dogs, but also beneficial for their health. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/">Fresh food is also easier for your pup to digest</a> than processed dog food and can lead to better breath, a shinier coat, and a trimmer waistline. How many brown balls of kibble can promise that?\r\n\r\nRemember, a few pieces of fresh turkey or broccoli in your dog’s bowl can be an amazing snack, but doesn’t count as a regular, balanced meal. If you want to experience the benefits of switching your dog over to an all-fresh diet, make sure you’re feeding<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/"> nutritionally balanced recipes</a> that have been formulated by a veterinary nutritionist.\r\n<h4><b>Any specific table scraps I should avoid?</b></h4>\r\nWhile certain table foods are safe to share with your dog, you should keep the pizza and French Fries for your own cheat days. Everyone knows about chocolate, but here’s a quick recap of the table scraps that still deserve their bad rep.\r\n\r\n– Fried foods or dishes with added salt and spices\r\n\r\n– Most Americans cook with copious amounts of butter and oil, making many holiday dishes a potential nutritional land mine for dogs (and humans)\r\n\r\n– Garlic and onion (they contain <i>allium</i>, which can damage your dog’s red blood cells and even cause them to burst)\r\n\r\n– Grapes and raisins (the exact toxin in this fruit family hasn’t been pinpointed, but grapes are high on the No Fly List for your dog’s bowl)\r\n\r\n– Packaged foods (artificial sweeteners like <em>x</em><em>ylitol</em> can sneak into packaged desserts, candies, and condiments and are some of the most dangerous ingredients for dogs)\r\n\r\n– Peaches and avocados (peach pits are poisonous, to say nothing of their danger as a choking hazard, while avocados contain a toxin called <i>persin</i>)\r\n\r\n– Tomato plants (a ripe tomato is fine, but a green tomato or any part of the plant itself can be toxic)\r\n\r\n– Cooked bones (chicken bones, we’re looking at you)\r\n\r\n– Raw potatoes (cooked is safe, but skip the buttery mashed variety)\r\n\r\nWhile your pup would no doubt love a plate of macaroni and cheese this holiday, rich foods can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even pancreatitis if consumed in high quantities. The good news is that your dog will be just as happy enjoying a plate of steamed Brussels sprouts dressed in Turkey broth. So go ahead, put some leftover superfoods in that bowl and let the dogs join in on the holiday fun this year.', 'The Truth About Table Scraps for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '24-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-28 16:26:02', '2018-03-28 14:26:02', '', 24, 'http://localhost/Foodog-SMGD/wordpress/index.php/2018/03/28/24-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n<h4>Chocolate</h4>\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n<h4>Garlic</h4>\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n<h4>Raisins</h4>\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n<h4>Candy</h4>\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots.

There are times, however, when something goes awry and your dog’s digestive system stops working as smoothly as it should.\r\n\r\nConstipation is a condition characterized by difficult, infrequent, or completely absent bowel movements. Dogs are normally very regular, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-your-dogs-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing stools</a> once or twice a day, but they are just as prone to digestive difficulties as humans. Here is what you need to know about constipation in your<em> </em>dog.\r\n<h4>What Causes Constipation in Dogs?</h4>\r\nConstipation is one of the most common digestive problems seen in dogs and is typically easy to diagnose. Some of the most common symptoms of constipation include:\r\n\r\n1. Forceful but ineffective attempts to defecate\r\n2. Small, hard, or dry stools Redness or swelling around the anus\r\n3. Discharge from the anus after defecating\r\n4. Loss of appetite and/or weight loss\r\n5. Lethargy or depression\r\n6. Pain when defecating\r\n7. Scooting the bottom on the floor\r\n\r\nIf your dog hasn’t had a bowel movement in more than a day or two, it is a sure sign of constipation. But what exactly leads to constipation?\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of causes ranging from inadequate fiber content in your dog’s diet to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>. Constipation can also be caused by an enlarged prostate gland, excessive self-grooming, injury or trauma to the pelvis, and various neurological disorders. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or the result of an intestinal blockage.\r\n<h4>What Can You Do About It?</h4>\r\nMild cases of constipation in dogs typically resolve themselves with time, but more severe cases may require intervention. If your dog has only been constipated for a day or two, something as simple as stirring a little canned pumpkin (the human-grade variety is perfect!) into his food can provide a boost of fiber that might get things moving again. Increasing your dog’s <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water intake </a>or switching to <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh food diet </a>with natural moisture can help as well.\r\n\r\nIf neither of these relieve your dog’s constipation, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a stool softener, laxative, or other medication to help get your dog’s digestion back on track. In some cases, an enema might become necessary to evacuate the bowel, but this is definitely not something you should try at home.\r\n<h4>How Do You Prevent Constipation?</h4>\r\nOlder dogs are more likely to develop constipation because their bowel activity naturally decreases with age. If your dog doesn’t drink a lot of water, he is also at risk for developing constipation. So, how do you prevent your dog from becoming constipated?\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do is feed your pup a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy, high-quality diet</a> that includes fresh, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real food</a>.

You may also want to consider supplementing with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotics</a> to help ensure healthy and regular digestion.\r\n\r\nThough constipation is usually a short-lived problem that resolves itself with time, chronic or prolonged constipation is not something you should ignore.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h4>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</h4>\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/wikipup-canine-dental-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teeth</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nails</a>, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n<h4>Grooming by coat type</h4>\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog?  Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an <em>undercoat</em>, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n<h4>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</h4>\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh, high quality protein source</a>, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair.

Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth.  A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">balanced meal plan</a>.

(58, 1, '2018-03-30 10:54:41', '2018-03-30 08:54:41', 'Fall is officially here, and for some dogs,  a new season means new allergies. In the fall, dogs are often allergic to weeds like ragweed that pollinate during autumn months. There are various medications made specifically for dogs experiencing allergies, but it’s often helpful to take a few extra preventative measures if you know your pup is prone to seasonal sniffles. We’ve rounded up the best ways to keep the sneezing and itching under control, DIY style.\r\n<h4>Foot Baths</h4>\r\nWhile humans experience allergies via air-transmitted pollen or ragweed, a dog’s allergic center is his skin. The skin on your dog’s paws is an especially vulnerable spot, and allergic reactions can be triggered when paws walk on grass or dig into damp piles of leaves with mold spores. That’s why dogs sometimes <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/why-your-dog-is-chewing-his-paws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chew their paws</a> — they’re itchy! Dipping your pup’s paws into a bucket of cool water when he comes in from the outside can help alleviate allergies and help stop the spread of pollen in your home.\r\n<h4>Fish Oil</h4>\r\nIt’s good for dogs, too! Fish oil is high in omega 3 fatty acids, which are known to reduce inflammation and can significantly help your allergy-prone dog’s red, itchy skin. Talk to your vet about a favorite fish oil supplement, or  start feeding <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com">fresh meals that contain fish oil</a>. And to make things easier, most dogs actually like the taste of fish oil. Unlike, say, most people.\r\n<h4>Major Flea Control</h4>\r\nNo dog wants fleas, but allergy-prone dogs need to be <em>especially</em> careful. Dogs can develop an allergy to fleas’ saliva, which not only makes bites worse but can also trigger a whole-body allergic reaction that’s difficult to reduce. Getting a high-quality flea medication and keeping your dog on it year-round is a smart investment for his health.

In the fall, dogs are often allergic to weeds like ragweed that pollinate during autumn months. There are various medications made specifically for dogs experiencing allergies, but it’s often helpful to take a few extra preventative measures if you know your pup is prone to seasonal sniffles. We’ve rounded up the best ways to keep the sneezing and itching under control, DIY style.\r\n<h4>Foot Baths</h4>\r\nWhile humans experience allergies via air-transmitted pollen or ragweed, a dog’s allergic center is his skin. The skin on your dog’s paws is an especially vulnerable spot, and allergic reactions can be triggered when paws walk on grass or dig into damp piles of leaves with mold spores. That’s why dogs sometimes <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/why-your-dog-is-chewing-his-paws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chew their paws</a> — they’re itchy! Dipping your pup’s paws into a bucket of cool water when he comes in from the outside can help alleviate allergies and help stop the spread of pollen in your home.\r\n<h4>Fish Oil</h4>\r\nIt’s good for dogs, too! Fish oil is high in omega 3 fatty acids, which are known to reduce inflammation and can significantly help your allergy-prone dog’s red, itchy skin. Talk to your vet about a favorite fish oil supplement, or  start feeding <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com">fresh meals that contain fish oil</a>. And to make things easier, most dogs actually like the taste of fish oil. Unlike, say, most people.\r\n<h4>Major Flea Control</h4>\r\nNo dog wants fleas, but allergy-prone dogs need to be <em>especially</em> careful. Dogs can develop an allergy to fleas’ saliva, which not only makes bites worse but can also trigger a whole-body allergic reaction that’s difficult to reduce. Getting a high-quality flea medication and keeping your dog on it year-round is a smart investment for his health.

Here’s what you need to know to keep your dog hydrated in the heat of the moment.\r\n<h4>What does a dehydrated dog look like?</h4>\r\nSerious signs of dehydration include sunken eyes, lethargy, loss of appetite, dry mouth and panting, and depression. Another way to tell if your dog is seriously dehydrated is by gently lifting the skin on his or her back. Assuming your dog is at a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/skinny-dogs-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy weight</a> and has had enough fluids, the skin should almost immediately fall back into its usual place. If your dog is dehydrated, the skin will not return to normal as quickly. Worried your dog is dehydrated? Call your vet, who may be able to administer IV fluid treatment if needed.\r\n\r\nIf your dog is sick with a kidney infection, heat stroke, or persistent diarrhea and/or vomiting, you can ask your vet to recommend a dog-friendly electrolyte solution. (We’re not talking about Gatorade.)\r\n<h4>How can you prevent dehydration in your dog?</h4>\r\nThis might sound obvious, but the best way to prevent dehydration is to keep an eye on your dog’s water intake. Keep an extra water bowl by the back door and make sure your dog’s primary bowl is full throughout the day, too. If you bring your dog out on a jog (or have him tag along to bottomless brunch), bring a portable water bowl and a water bottle to refill it with. And consider the size of your dog’s bowl; if it’s too large, your pup may have trouble slurping the water down. Lastly, don’t forget to clean the bowl regularly — you wouldn’t want to drink from a dirty glass, and your dog won’t, either. Bacteria can also form around the sides of an unwashed bowl, making your dog sick.\r\n<h4>How much water is too much water?</h4>\r\nYour dog should drink an ounce of water per pound every day. In other words, if your pup weighs 25 lbs., he should be drinking at least 25 oz. of water per day. The key word here is <em>at least</em> — an ounce per pound is a great starting goal, but doesn’t incorporate shifting factors like outside temperature, exercise, or any dehydrating medications your pup might be on. Try keeping your dog’s bowl consistently filled with twice the amount of water he needs to be safe.\r\n<h4>You are what you eat.</h4>\r\nMany pet owners overlook how a dog’s diet can affect hydration levels. Water makes up about 10 percent of commercial dry foods, which is why you may notice your dog gulping down his water bowl after crunching on kibble. Freeze-dried options are transformed in a <em>dehydration </em>process, which can also lead to less water consumption via food than a dog’s body is expecting.\r\n\r\nFeeding <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> is the ideal here, as many fruits and vegetables have a water composition above 90 percent. About 20 percent of your dog’s water intake can come from proper diet, so try incorporating <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh snacks</a> as often as possible, especially during hotter months.

(66, 1, '2018-03-30 10:58:45', '2018-03-30 08:58:45', 'Let’s be honest. When a couple says “We’re getting a dog!” we all know what they actually mean is, “Things are getting pretty serious, so this is a baby test run.”\r\n\r\nI’m not a mom yet, but I’ve often thought about my own puppy and baby timeline. Do I get a puppy first and acclimate to the responsibility before having kids? Or do I get — I mean, have — a baby first and get a puppy later when the baby is old enough to help walk it? Yes, these are the things I think about. (Side note: Please don’t tell my boyfriend I wrote this.)\r\n\r\nIf you do go the dog before baby route, you’ll want to adequately prepare your pup for his new human sibling to ensure a smooth transition and peaceful relationship. I spoke to Emily Cohen-Moreira, founder of <a href="http://lucythelaborer.com/">Lucy the Laborer</a> and Certified Labor Support Doula, about tricks for prepping your pup for a new baby in the house. What can I say? I like to plan ahead.\r\n\r\n<strong>Before bringing your baby back from the hospital, bring home swaddle blankets for your dog to smell.</strong>\r\n\r\nYou can put blankets or baby hats in your dog’s bed to familiarize him with the scent before the baby actually comes home.\r\n\r\n<strong>Consider your dog’s sleeping routine.</strong>\r\n\r\n“Dog owners that have the dog <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-sharing-a-bed-with-your-dog-affects-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleeping in the bed</a> with them don’t always think about boundaries that they need to create before the baby is born,” Emily explains. Babies are supposed to sleep in their parents’ room for the first six to twelve months, so if the baby is in the bed, the dog definitely shouldn’t be. “That’s a challenge I’ve seen some of my clients have.”\r\n\r\n<strong>If you’re having a home birth, come up with a plan for your what your pup will be doing during labor.</strong>\r\n\r\n“Whenever I have clients having home births, I always ask, ‘What’s the plan for the pets?’ Some dogs are great and kind of hang out in the corner, while other are more high-need or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxious</a>. I once had a home birth with a family who had never had any kind of boundaries with their dog, and the poor dog was really freaking out.” Home births involve a lot of excitement (and sterile equipment), so if your dog is sticking around, make sure he isn’t prone to jumping on the bed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Snuggle with your dog during labor – it’s biologically good for you.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis one is also specific to home births. “Snuggling with your dog gives you an oxytocin rush, which is great for encouraging labor progress and tends to be really soothing and comforting.” If this is a route you see yourself taking, make sure your dog acclimates to your midwife before labor. “You don’t want the dog to start freaking out or become overprotective.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Incorporate your dog into new, daily routines with the baby.</strong>\r\n\r\n“For my clients who breastfeed, I always recommend that they pet or talk to the dog while they’re sitting there. When you’re taking the baby out for a walk, try to bring the dog. Learn to use a baby carrier so that you can walk the dog at the same time. Sometimes people will try to keep the dog out of the baby’s room in order to differentiate space, but you also don’t want to create an environment where the dog feels left out or punished.”\r\n\r\n<strong>It might not be your instinct to prioritize the dog when you have a screaming baby – and that’s okay.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you’ve just had a baby, every instinct in your body is telling you to focus on nothing else but that tiny human. It’s not easy to admit, but in those early days, even your beloved dog can feel like an annoyance. “If you try to make a really conscious effort to involve the dog in all of your routines and activities, it becomes a lot smoother for everybody,” Emily advises.\r\n\r\n<strong>Be aware of potential toy mixups.</strong>\r\n\r\n“Even though my dog was disruptive with his own toys, he learned very quickly how to differentiate between his stuff and the baby’s.” I was surprised by how little effort it took for him to realize, okay, this is her stuffed animal, so I’m not going to rip it apart.

(67, 1, '2018-03-30 10:58:45', '2018-03-30 08:58:45', 'Let’s be honest. When a couple says “We’re getting a dog!” we all know what they actually mean is, “Things are getting pretty serious, so this is a baby test run.”\r\n\r\nI’m not a mom yet, but I’ve often thought about my own puppy and baby timeline. Do I get a puppy first and acclimate to the responsibility before having kids? Or do I get — I mean, have — a baby first and get a puppy later when the baby is old enough to help walk it? Yes, these are the things I think about. (Side note: Please don’t tell my boyfriend I wrote this.)\r\n\r\nIf you do go the dog before baby route, you’ll want to adequately prepare your pup for his new human sibling to ensure a smooth transition and peaceful relationship. I spoke to Emily Cohen-Moreira, founder of <a href="http://lucythelaborer.com/">Lucy the Laborer</a> and Certified Labor Support Doula, about tricks for prepping your pup for a new baby in the house. What can I say? I like to plan ahead.\r\n\r\n<strong>Before bringing your baby back from the hospital, bring home swaddle blankets for your dog to smell.</strong>\r\n\r\nYou can put blankets or baby hats in your dog’s bed to familiarize him with the scent before the baby actually comes home.\r\n\r\n<strong>Consider your dog’s sleeping routine.</strong>\r\n\r\n“Dog owners that have the dog <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-sharing-a-bed-with-your-dog-affects-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleeping in the bed</a> with them don’t always think about boundaries that they need to create before the baby is born,” Emily explains. Babies are supposed to sleep in their parents’ room for the first six to twelve months, so if the baby is in the bed, the dog definitely shouldn’t be. “That’s a challenge I’ve seen some of my clients have.”\r\n\r\n<strong>If you’re having a home birth, come up with a plan for your what your pup will be doing during labor.</strong>\r\n\r\n“Whenever I have clients having home births, I always ask, ‘What’s the plan for the pets?’ Some dogs are great and kind of hang out in the corner, while other are more high-need or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxious</a>. I once had a home birth with a family who had never had any kind of boundaries with their dog, and the poor dog was really freaking out.” Home births involve a lot of excitement (and sterile equipment), so if your dog is sticking around, make sure he isn’t prone to jumping on the bed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Snuggle with your dog during labor – it’s biologically good for you.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis one is also specific to home births. “Snuggling with your dog gives you an oxytocin rush, which is great for encouraging labor progress and tends to be really soothing and comforting.” If this is a route you see yourself taking, make sure your dog acclimates to your midwife before labor. “You don’t want the dog to start freaking out or become overprotective.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Incorporate your dog into new, daily routines with the baby.</strong>\r\n\r\n“For my clients who breastfeed, I always recommend that they pet or talk to the dog while they’re sitting there. When you’re taking the baby out for a walk, try to bring the dog. Learn to use a baby carrier so that you can walk the dog at the same time. Sometimes people will try to keep the dog out of the baby’s room in order to differentiate space, but you also don’t want to create an environment where the dog feels left out or punished.”\r\n\r\n<strong>It might not be your instinct to prioritize the dog when you have a screaming baby – and that’s okay.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you’ve just had a baby, every instinct in your body is telling you to focus on nothing else but that tiny human. It’s not easy to admit, but in those early days, even your beloved dog can feel like an annoyance. “If you try to make a really conscious effort to involve the dog in all of your routines and activities, it becomes a lot smoother for everybody,” Emily advises.\r\n\r\n<strong>Be aware of potential toy mixups.</strong>\r\n\r\n“Even though my dog was disruptive with his own toys, he learned very quickly how to differentiate between his stuff and the baby’s.” I was surprised by how little effort it took for him to realize, okay, this is her stuffed animal, so I’m not going to rip it apart. I didn’t feel like I had to punish him or yell at him about it.”\r\n\r\nYour dog might surprise you, too, but it’s still always a good idea to keep any potentially unsafe toys out of reach for both baby and dog.\r\n\r\n<strong>Age matters.</strong>\r\n\r\nUnless you hate sleep, it’s probably not the best idea to get a new puppy the same week you go into labor.\r\n\r\n“Most pets do great with babies, but I think it can also depend on the age of the dog,” Emily shares.\r\n\r\nStill, having a baby and dog somewhat close in age can make for some incredible shared milestones.\r\n\r\n“My dog was two when we had our baby, so we were definitely thinking about them having a life together.

But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans.

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\r\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\r\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\r\n\r\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it.

It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\r\n\r\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it. And if nothing else, it will give him a reason to work for those treats.', 'How Your Therapy Dog Can Change Someone’s Life', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '72-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-30 11:06:41', '2018-03-30 09:06:41', '', 72, 'http://localhost/Foodog-SMGD/wordpress/index.php/2018/03/30/72-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n<h4>Mating</h4>\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control.

If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n<h4>Fear</h4>\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n<h4>New Surroundings</h4>\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n<h4>Bad Habits</h4>\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n<h4>Excitement</h4>\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n<h4>Opportunity</h4>\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away.

This is when dogs might swallow the sock – just when you get close enough to reclaim it from their grasp, they swallow it in the ultimate claim of victory.\r\n<h4>Dogs might actually think socks are valuable.</h4>\r\nDogs, like humans, have a notion of a “resource” – something they find valuable and worth protecting at all costs. If dogs come to the conclusion that an inanimate object like a sock (or a special toy, bone, stick, etc.) is valuable and worth guarding, then they will guard it with all their might.

(78, 1, '2018-03-30 11:09:38', '2018-03-30 09:09:38', 'Without realizing it, we think a lot about our dogs’ sleeping habits. We buy them fancy beds (but typically tend to let them<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-sharing-a-bed-with-your-dog-affects-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> sleep in our own</a>), and laugh at the silly positions they find themselves in as they doze off. We even take them on <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog-this-spring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long walks</a> to get out their energy and jumpstart that afternoon nap because, as much as we love them, sometimes it’s nice to get a few hours off from fetch, belly rubs, and barking at the neighbors. But what’s actually going on while your pup is catching those Z’s? And how much sleep should he <em>really </em>be getting? Let’s take a closer look.\r\n<h4>How much sleep does a healthy dog need?</h4>\r\nThis varies depending mainly on the age and size of your pooch. A standard adult dog will spend roughly 12-14 hours a day sleeping. Older dogs require more sleep because their normal daily routine simply tires them out more than their younger counterparts. This is similar to why larger dogs also need more sleep than smaller breeds. Puppies sleep a ton – upwards of 20 hours a day! – because while they’re awake they are hyperactive and constantly exploring and learning new things.\r\n<h4>What do their sleep patterns look like?</h4>\r\nSleep is broken into two distinct phases for both humans and dogs: REM and NREM (rapid and non-rapid-eye-movement). You fall asleep into NREM, but restorative sleep – the kind that truly allows you to “recharge your battery” – is REM. The issue is that while humans spend 25% of their sleep in the REM cycle, dogs experience REM only 10% of the time. Additionally, dogs are “flexible sleepers,” often jolted awake by any number of sounds that indicate an activity they’d like to take part in (a ball bouncing, a can opener whirring, a leash jingling). For both of these reasons, they require far more sleep than humans to reach a sufficient level of that restorative REM sleep.\r\n<h4>What’s with all the weird/adorable positions dogs sleep in?</h4>\r\nAs with many other strange or silly dog behaviors, their sleeping positions are vestiges of their past as wild animals, specifically as it related to their security. <strong>Curling</strong><strong> up in a ball </strong>nose to tail, for instance, was to protect their vital organs from predators, as well as to better fit into the rest of their sleeping pack as they kept each other warm. When they sleep <strong>on their side</strong>, their organs are exposed but they can also pop up pretty quickly and be ready to run or fight. Plopping down <strong>on their belly </strong>gives them the best combination of organ protection and general readiness, while the silliest looking variation – lying flat <strong>on their back</strong> with their legs in the air – is the exact opposite and can indicate a sense of comfort with their surroundings.\r\n\r\nSince safety is pretty much guaranteed for domesticated dogs, their sleeping positions will likely vary naturally and may not directly indicate how secure they feel. Still, it’s definitely possible that an anxious pup is more likely to sleep in a “safer” position, particularly if he finds himself in a new situation or in the company of strangers.\r\n<h4>Do dogs dream?</h4>\r\nYes! Just this morning my dog told me about this crazy dream he had that involved a squirrel, a pigeon, and a pizza crust on the sidewalk. But actually, studies have shown that dogs likely dream in a similar way as humans, meaning they dream about events that happened in their day. In addition to simply reading brain waves and watching their eyes dart back and forth during REM sleep, scientists have taken their investigation of canine sleep patterns a step further.\r\n\r\nWhen a REM cycle begins, a part of our brain called the <em>pons</em> activates to paralyze our limbs, ensuring we don’t act out our dreams and hurt ourselves. In lab settings, researchers deactivated the pons in sleeping dogs and witnessed physical movements that indicated dream activity. Sleeping Pointers, for example, went on point and Springer Spaniels darted back and forth, as if flushing a flock of birds from a meadow. Sweet dreams, doggies.\r\n\r\nLike humans, every dog has quirks and idiosyncrasies that can apply to his sleeping behavior and preferences, as well. As long as those routines remain consistent and sit somewhere in the normal range for a dog of his age and size, then just let that sleeping dog lie. And while he’s dozing, please do your part and set up an Instagram account so we can continue documenting dogs’ collective penchant for looking hilarious when they’re snoozing.

We even take them on <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog-this-spring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long walks</a> to get out their energy and jumpstart that afternoon nap because, as much as we love them, sometimes it’s nice to get a few hours off from fetch, belly rubs, and barking at the neighbors. But what’s actually going on while your pup is catching those Z’s? And how much sleep should he <em>really </em>be getting? Let’s take a closer look.\r\n<h4>How much sleep does a healthy dog need?</h4>\r\nThis varies depending mainly on the age and size of your pooch. A standard adult dog will spend roughly 12-14 hours a day sleeping. Older dogs require more sleep because their normal daily routine simply tires them out more than their younger counterparts. This is similar to why larger dogs also need more sleep than smaller breeds. Puppies sleep a ton – upwards of 20 hours a day! – because while they’re awake they are hyperactive and constantly exploring and learning new things.\r\n<h4>What do their sleep patterns look like?</h4>\r\nSleep is broken into two distinct phases for both humans and dogs: REM and NREM (rapid and non-rapid-eye-movement). You fall asleep into NREM, but restorative sleep – the kind that truly allows you to “recharge your battery” – is REM. The issue is that while humans spend 25% of their sleep in the REM cycle, dogs experience REM only 10% of the time. Additionally, dogs are “flexible sleepers,” often jolted awake by any number of sounds that indicate an activity they’d like to take part in (a ball bouncing, a can opener whirring, a leash jingling). For both of these reasons, they require far more sleep than humans to reach a sufficient level of that restorative REM sleep.\r\n<h4>What’s with all the weird/adorable positions dogs sleep in?</h4>\r\nAs with many other strange or silly dog behaviors, their sleeping positions are vestiges of their past as wild animals, specifically as it related to their security. <strong>Curling</strong><strong> up in a ball </strong>nose to tail, for instance, was to protect their vital organs from predators, as well as to better fit into the rest of their sleeping pack as they kept each other warm. When they sleep <strong>on their side</strong>, their organs are exposed but they can also pop up pretty quickly and be ready to run or fight. Plopping down <strong>on their belly </strong>gives them the best combination of organ protection and general readiness, while the silliest looking variation – lying flat <strong>on their back</strong> with their legs in the air – is the exact opposite and can indicate a sense of comfort with their surroundings.\r\n\r\nSince safety is pretty much guaranteed for domesticated dogs, their sleeping positions will likely vary naturally and may not directly indicate how secure they feel. Still, it’s definitely possible that an anxious pup is more likely to sleep in a “safer” position, particularly if he finds himself in a new situation or in the company of strangers.\r\n<h4>Do dogs dream?</h4>\r\nYes! Just this morning my dog told me about this crazy dream he had that involved a squirrel, a pigeon, and a pizza crust on the sidewalk. But actually, studies have shown that dogs likely dream in a similar way as humans, meaning they dream about events that happened in their day. In addition to simply reading brain waves and watching their eyes dart back and forth during REM sleep, scientists have taken their investigation of canine sleep patterns a step further.\r\n\r\nWhen a REM cycle begins, a part of our brain called the <em>pons</em> activates to paralyze our limbs, ensuring we don’t act out our dreams and hurt ourselves. In lab settings, researchers deactivated the pons in sleeping dogs and witnessed physical movements that indicated dream activity. Sleeping Pointers, for example, went on point and Springer Spaniels darted back and forth, as if flushing a flock of birds from a meadow. Sweet dreams, doggies.\r\n\r\nLike humans, every dog has quirks and idiosyncrasies that can apply to his sleeping behavior and preferences, as well. As long as those routines remain consistent and sit somewhere in the normal range for a dog of his age and size, then just let that sleeping dog lie. And while he’s dozing, please do your part and set up an Instagram account so we can continue documenting dogs’ collective penchant for looking hilarious when they’re snoozing.

By carefully considering the factors below, you’ll adopt the dog who will fit right into your lifestyle.\r\n<h4>Home Life</h4>\r\nOne of the main factors to evaluate is the environment you’ll be bringing your new dog into. Having small children at home may mean that a quieter and well-socialized dog would fit in better. If you already have a pet, make sure your old dog won’t mind having a couple of new siblings around the house. You want your rescue to feel welcome in his new home!\r\n<h4>Time for Training</h4>\r\nAnother important decision to make is how much time you are willing to devote to training. It’s no surprise that a puppy will involve much more crate and behavioral training than an adult dog. If you work from home or have a flexible schedule, a young pup may not be an issue, but if your weekly to-do list already feels overwhelming, it’s probably a better idea to adopt a dog that is already well trained. The biggest mistake people make is taking home the cutest puppy only to realize later how much work he requires. Sadly, it’s one of the main reasons dogs end up back in shelters. To make sure this doesn’t happen, pick a dog who is appropriate for your current life schedule.\r\n<h4>Activity Level</h4>\r\nAfter considering training, think about how you like to spend your downtime. If you’re a runner, maybe you’ll want an active, energetic dog who will jog beside you. Perhaps Netflix and chill is more your speed? You’ll enjoy having fellow a couch potato around the house. Understanding your behavioral patterns can help you determine the age and energy level that will fit in best with your routine.\r\n<h4>Cost</h4>\r\nThe financial breakdown of owning a dog is a big factor that some people forget to fully consider. A large dog will require more food and thus cost more than his smaller counterpart. Likewise, long haired dogs are beautiful but often have to be groomed professionally, which can get expensive. Some buildings and landlords also have pet weight restrictions, so it’s important to make sure you are staying well within your regulations to avoid fines. Adopting a dog who you will be able to financially care for long term is the best thing you can do for your new companion.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve decided on all the above criteria, you’re ready to pick the perfect pup!

Don’t fret; some general training and desensitization tips will help your dog become the perfect couch companion.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is identify what it is about the television that triggers your dog. Is it other dogs on TV? Does your dog get worked up when you jump up in excitement over a game-winning touchdown? Make a list of all the television related triggers for your dog. Once you have your list, you can begin desensitizing, counterconditioning, and training your dog.\r\n\r\n<b>Desensitizing</b> your dog to something is a careful game of exposing him to the stimulus that sets him off — just enough for him to notice, but not so much that he gets triggered. The easiest way to desensitize a dog to television-related triggers is to record a program on your DVR and have it available to play easily. Next, cover the TV with a light sheet in order to dim the colors without covering the picture entirely. You will also want to make sure the volume is set to low if sound is a factor. By dimming the screen and lowering the volume, you are lessening the intensity of the stimuli that cause your dog to trigger. This will hopefully allow him to be exposed to these sounds and images without misbehaving. Over time, you can gradually increase the intensity by uncovering the TV and raising the volume.\r\n\r\n<b>Counter conditioning</b> is the idea that ‘the good follows the bad.’ You’ve already used desensitization to expose your dog to the “bad” (i.e. a dog on TV). Counter conditioning means following this exposure with something good (like a very tasty treat). Be careful; only provide a treat to reinforce <b>good behavior</b> in the face of the trigger. Over time, your dog will associate staying calm in front of the TV with a reward.\r\n\r\nAnother option is training your dog with a strong “stay” cue. Owners often train a stay for distance, meaning they ask their dog to “stay” and then walk away and measure success in how far they can get without their dog moving. You can also train your dog to stay during distractions and, in this case, measure success by your dog’s ability to stay calm while a dog barks loudly on TV.\r\n\r\nTo train a “stay” with distractions you will want to have your distraction ready, ask your dog to stay, expose him to the distraction (but only briefly), then praise him for not moving and reward him with a small treat. Repeat very slowly and then release your dog from the position he is in to end the stay. If you are having trouble, get back to basics. Focus on mastering a basic stay cue without distractions first, and then work your way up.\r\n\r\nIf you have never done any training and you are struggling with your dog’s behavior at TV time, it might be best to consult a certified, positive trainer who will be able to help you get this behavior under control.

While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one.

It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers.

You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n<h4>Fundraise</h4>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n<h4>Donate</h4>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead.

How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual!

Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast.

If you’re anything like me (and I think you are if you’re feeding <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com">The Farmer’s Dog</a>!), then 2 extra years with your dog is precious time.\r\n\r\n<b>Obesity</b> is defined as a 20% increase from normal body weight. This means that if your dog should weigh 10 pounds but actually weighs 12 pounds, he is considered obese.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, an estimated 59% of cats and 54% of dogs in the US are overweight or obese. Unfortunately, based on my expertise and the number of animals I see every day, I would say this statistic is accurate. Just like in humans, obesity predisposes your pet to health issues like arthritis, heart/respiratory disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.\r\n\r\nSo how can you determine if your pet is at an ideal weight? First off, their ribs should be easily felt when petting them with the palm of your hand. Their abdomens should also be tucked and not sagging when viewing their bodies from the side, and their waists should be visible from overhead behind the ribs.\r\n\r\nIf your pet isn’t at his most svelte, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions such as hypothyroidism as a cause of obesity. Always speak to your veterinarian about screening your pet for these conditions, especially if your pet is middle-aged.\r\n\r\nOnce your pet has been cleared for any underlying health issues, you can move on to evaluating other causes of obesity:\r\n\r\n<strong>Are they getting enough exercise?</strong>\r\n\r\nIn order to be successful, a weight loss plan needs to include both a reduction in calories and an increase in exercise. The goal should be to lose between 1-2% of body weight every week. However, losing weight too quickly can also be dangerous. It’s best to speak to your veterinarian regarding how many kilocalories are appropriate for weight loss and what type of food/exercise is recommended.\r\n\r\n<strong>Are they eating too many treats/human food?</strong>\r\n\r\nOften we don’t realize that giving a dog a bully stick is the equivalent of a jelly donut. <a href="http://mag.thefarmersdog.com/2016/07/28/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy alternatives</a> for dog treats include celery, green beans, and freeze dried beef liver. A general rule of thumb is that your pet should receive no more than 10% of his daily caloric intake from treats.\r\n\r\nDespite those puppy dog eyes, love for your pet should not be displayed by overdoing the high calorie food and treats. It should be displayed by praise and attention, long walks, and working to maintain a healthy weight. So next time you order too much at dinner, forget the doggy bag and grab the leash.

But whether hopping on the subway or jet setting to escape the winter weather, being unprepared can quickly turn your trip from peaceful to panic-filled. Don’t start calling the petsitter just yet! <em>Off Leash</em> put together a go-to pre-travel checklist for a stress-free, and safe trip.\r\n<h4><strong>Wellness Check</strong></h4>\r\nThe stress of traveling coupled with a new and strange environment can trigger the expression of an underlying condition in your pet. To minimize the risk of any unexpected problems, make sure your pet is up to date with their bi-annual wellness check or schedule an appointment.\r\n<h4><strong>Health Certificate</strong></h4>\r\nCertificates of veterinary inspection, required for out of state travel only, confirm that your pet has been recently examined, is free from signs of infectious disease, and is up to date on vaccines. Health certificates must be obtained through a specially licensed veterinarian at least 10 days prior to travel. Can’t make it to the vet and still meet your work deadline? Don’t stress! Off Leash vets are licensed and can come straight to your home or office at your convenience.\r\n<h4><strong>Medication</strong></h4>\r\nMedication is an option for anxiety or motion sickness in pets. Since adverse reactions to medication are unpredictable, never try a new drug on the day of travel.  If you have any particular concerns, discuss with your veterinarian and develop an action plan to keep both you and your pet safe and relaxed. Remember to be sure that all prescriptions are up to date and refilled prior to travel.\r\n<h4><strong>Luggage</strong></h4>\r\nIf your pet is not a certified ESA animal, the airline will require him or her to be in a soft or hard kennel that is well ventilated and leak-proof. Larger pets will most likely have to travel as cargo in a USDA-approved hard kennel. We’re big fans of Sherpa’s Snoozer Wheel Around. Any carrier should be properly labeled with your name, your pet’s name, and an emergency contact number. Always check for additional restrictions and regulations with your airline in advance of travel.\r\n<h4><strong>Poop Bags</strong></h4>\r\nNo explanation needed…be prepared.\r\n<h4><strong>Bones and Toys</strong></h4>\r\nSimilarly to all the books and movies you downloaded for your trip, your pet needs their fair share of entertainment. Make sure to pack your pet’s favorite toys in an easily accessible place. Avoid new toys or treats to prevent unforeseen choking hazards or gastrointestinal upset.\r\n<h4><strong>Food and Water</strong></h4>\r\nThe physical demands of air travel, as well as adding stress and panting, increases our pets’ energy and water demands.

But whether hopping on the subway or jet setting to escape the winter weather, being unprepared can quickly turn your trip from peaceful to panic-filled. Don’t start calling the petsitter just yet! <em>Off Leash</em> put together a go-to pre-travel checklist for a stress-free, and safe trip.\r\n<h4><strong>Wellness Check</strong></h4>\r\nThe stress of traveling coupled with a new and strange environment can trigger the expression of an underlying condition in your pet. To minimize the risk of any unexpected problems, make sure your pet is up to date with their bi-annual wellness check or schedule an appointment.\r\n<h4><strong>Health Certificate</strong></h4>\r\nCertificates of veterinary inspection, required for out of state travel only, confirm that your pet has been recently examined, is free from signs of infectious disease, and is up to date on vaccines. Health certificates must be obtained through a specially licensed veterinarian at least 10 days prior to travel. Can’t make it to the vet and still meet your work deadline? Don’t stress! Off Leash vets are licensed and can come straight to your home or office at your convenience.\r\n<h4><strong>Medication</strong></h4>\r\nMedication is an option for anxiety or motion sickness in pets. Since adverse reactions to medication are unpredictable, never try a new drug on the day of travel.  If you have any particular concerns, discuss with your veterinarian and develop an action plan to keep both you and your pet safe and relaxed. Remember to be sure that all prescriptions are up to date and refilled prior to travel.\r\n<h4><strong>Luggage</strong></h4>\r\nIf your pet is not a certified ESA animal, the airline will require him or her to be in a soft or hard kennel that is well ventilated and leak-proof. Larger pets will most likely have to travel as cargo in a USDA-approved hard kennel. We’re big fans of Sherpa’s Snoozer Wheel Around. Any carrier should be properly labeled with your name, your pet’s name, and an emergency contact number. Always check for additional restrictions and regulations with your airline in advance of travel.\r\n<h4><strong>Poop Bags</strong></h4>\r\nNo explanation needed…be prepared.\r\n<h4><strong>Bones and Toys</strong></h4>\r\nSimilarly to all the books and movies you downloaded for your trip, your pet needs their fair share of entertainment. Make sure to pack your pet’s favorite toys in an easily accessible place. Avoid new toys or treats to prevent unforeseen choking hazards or gastrointestinal upset.\r\n<h4><strong>Food and Water</strong></h4>\r\nThe physical demands of air travel, as well as adding stress and panting, increases our pets’ energy and water demands. Make sure to offer ample food and water within 4 hours of travel. Small, travel-friendly dishes should be available at all times during the trip.', 'A Vet’s Guide to Traveling With Your Dog', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '115-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-30 11:29:51', '2018-03-30 09:29:51', '', 115, 'http://localhost/Foodog-SMGD/wordpress/index.php/2018/03/30/115-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Melissa is a dog trainer in Boston, Massachusetts and has a special interest in dogs living in urban environments with their owners. She is the author of Considerations for the City Dog which is available on Kindle and on Amazon.</em>\n\n“Rex, we’re late. We have to walk fast; I don’t have time for you to sniff. Let’s GO!”\n\nDoes this sound like your typical morning walk? You’re hustling to clock the requisite route with your dog, and all he wants to do is sniff. While it may slow you down, it turns out that your dog might get more out of “reading” the morning pee-mail than from walking a longer distance without stopping to sniff.\n\nAccording to Dr. Alexandra Horowicz, canine researcher and author of <em>Being a Dog: Following a Dog into the World of Smell</em>, dogs have 50 times as many scent receptors as humans. They have approximately 300 million scent receptors in their noses, and an additional organ called the <i>vemoronasal organ </i>above the roof of their mouths and under their noses. So while your dog is licking the ground and tasting the air, he is acquiring extremely detailed information through his superior olfactory organ.\n\nIn comparison, humans only have a measly six million scent receptors and no additional scent trapping organs. Aside from the brachycephalic brethren (think: dogs with squished faces like Boston terriers and pugs), most dogs have longer snouts which they use to process all of the information coming into their nasal passages. They see the world through their noses, which is why your pup might miss the tennis ball you just threw for him but will sniff the ground and “look” for it with his nose later.\n\nWe credentialed, science-based dog trainers recommend giving dogs more opportunities to sniff on walks and explore their natural worlds in a way that makes sense to them. This ensures that they get more mental stimulation and are generally happier.\n\nI tested this with my previous dog, Sadie-Jane. Sadie was a Border Collie who, for better or worse, lived in an urban environment. Buses, neighbors, and police cars whizzed by at all hours of the night, and she struggled to cope with city life. To keep her healthy and calm, I incorporated daily runs and aerobic activity into her days and scheduled rounds of competitive canine disc on weekends. While her aerobic and agility exercises built her physical endurance, the only activity that kept her truly calm was scent work. Letting her sniff on walks and giving her permission to use her nose in a good scent work class was the best thing I ever did f\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href="http://localhost/Foodog-SMGD/wordpress/wp-admin/post-new.php">Ajouter</a></li>\n</ul>\nor her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKate Bigger, President of Performance Scent Dogs Inc., says this about dogs who are allowed to use their noses: “In a good scent work class, we become teammates with our dog in a game they are so much better at than us, and we become participants in a game they love! It’s the ultimate test of our willingness to suspend our need to control [our dog’s actions] and help our dogs be successful as they navigate the invisible world of scent.”\n\nDogs still need daily aerobic activity, impulse control training, and to work for their treats in training in order to keep their brains active. But dogs <i>also</i> need to use what their mommas gave ‘em. They have noses that are as important to them as our eyes are to us. And every time they’re on a really good scent, it’s like they are seeing the lights of Times Square on New Year’s Eve.\n\nSo to your dog, that morning walk is actually going something like this:\n\n<strong>You:</strong> We’re late.\n<strong>Rex:</strong> Hey, this is some great info!\n<strong>You:</strong> Let’s GO.\n<strong>Rex:</strong> But, you have no idea! The Shih Tzu from down the street is expecting a litter! I read it in the daily!\n\nWhile we certainly reap the<a href="http://mag.thefarmersdog.com/2016/07/29/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/"> health benefits </a>of walking with our pups, we also have a lot we can learn from them when we let them stop and sniff the roses. Let your dog linger in the morning for a few extra seconds, or try scent work classes for new search and scenting activities that will keep your dog focused and mentally fit. Just make sure your pup is sticking to sniffing —not eating— those uncovered sidewalk treasures.', 'The Importance of Letting Your Dog Sniff', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:15:21', '2018-04-09 07:15:21', '', 110, 'http://localhost/Foodog-SMGD/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/110-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(203, 1, '2018-04-13 16:20:57', '2018-04-13 14:20:57', 'My earliest understanding of dog psychology stemmed from <em>Rugrats</em>, the Nickelodeon children’s cartoon I faithfully watched at 6am on Saturday mornings. The show’s protagonist, Tommy Pickles, had a dog (a Siberian Tiger Hound, to be precise) named Spike.\r\n<figure id="attachment_1350" class="wp-caption alignleft"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spike Pickles, circa 1991</figcaption></figure>\r\nHere’s the thing about Spike — he was in almost every episode of <em>Rugrats</em>. And while Tommy Pickles’ parents, Stu and Didi, thought that Spike was an aloof dog, dedicated viewers knew the real truth. During episodes in which we had the opportunity to see things from Spike’s point of view, audiences learned just how aware dogs are. Spike protected Tommy and the other babies from danger, lead them on spectacular adventures, and sparked the notion in kids everywhere that, like us, dogs have a unique way of seeing the world.\r\n\r\nAny dog owner will attest to the fact that our dogs have individual personalities. One of my pups, Theo, is infamous for his stupidity and constant euphoria — he’s the “happiest dog in the world,” as we say. Winnie, my other dog, is prone to growling and yapping at people, stealing our socks obsessively, and showing signs of antisocial behavior. And yet, she’s brilliant. She listens flawlessly, loves playing fetch, and will always “drop it” when you tell her to.\r\n\r\nI’ve always wondered if these unique character traits are a product of Winnie and Theo’s respective DNA. Theo is some sort of a Labradoodle mutt who we rescued from Texas, while Winnie is a purebred Cockapoo from a well-respected breeder in Pennsylvania. But is breed what determines a dog’s personality? And if it doesn’t, then what metric can we use to better understand the type of people our pups might be?\r\n\r\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a test based on principles stated by psychologist Carl Jung. Jung concluded that there are 16 different personality types, and the MBTI helps a person deduct which of the 16 they are. The (admittedly unofficial) version of the test I took online provides users with statements like, “You do not usually initiate conversations,” and “Winning a debate matters less to you than making sure no one gets upset.” I then used a sliding scale to annotate how strongly I agreed or disagreed in order to determine my personality type.\r\n\r\nThe 16 types are referred to by an abbreviation of four letters — the initial letters of each of the four type preferences, i.e. extraversion (E), intuition (N), feeling (F), judgment (J). Some people believe you can use this data to match with the ideal breed for you or to determine what dog breed you would be. I’m an ENFJ, which, according to the Internet, means I’m a Border Collie. We both share ENTJ tendencies like curiosity, unlimited energy, and an “intense stare.” Cute.\r\n\r\nI considered taking the MBTI on behalf of Winnie and Theo (which I still haven’t fully ruled out) but decided to search for a similar, canine-specific alternative. <a href="https://www.dognition.com/">Dognition</a>, a site that launched in 2013, gives paid users access to the Dognition Assessment, which provides interactive games and expert analyses on how your dog sees the world. The games analyze five central cognitive areas: empathy, communication, cunning, memory, and reasoning. At the end of the assessment, dog owners receive a report that labels their pup as one of nine personality types, with names like “Einstein” or “Charmer.”\r\n\r\nMany people believe breed says a lot about a dog’s disposition, but it might be a bit more nuanced than that. The <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201304/does-genetics-determine-dogs-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dog Genome Project</a> concluded that dog genes are actually what determines personality, meaning that when dogs of the same breed share genes, personality traits are passed down through those genes as well.\r\n\r\nBut as much as genetics determine a dog (or a human’s) outward expression, external stimuli and social environment can have a major impact as well. Dogs who were once abused or neglected, for instance, can suffer from prolonged psychological damage and behave much differently than other dogs of the same breed. On the other hand, dogs have an incredible ability to love deeply even after experiencing some of the worst sides of humanity, and their personalities can evolve and shine in new environments.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I’m still left with a few key questions. Am I a Collie? Is my dog, Winnie, just a mean girl? And, perhaps most importantly, what would Spike Pickles’ personality type be?
